# Advanced Formal Language Theory (263-5352-00L; Fr√ºhjahr 2023)

[Website](https://rycolab.io/classes/aflt-s23/)

This course serves as an introduction to various advanced topics in formal language theory. The primary focus of the course is on weighted formalisms, which can easily be applied in machine learning. Topics include finite-state machines as well as the algorithms that are commonly used for their manipulation. We will also cover weighted context-free grammars, weighted tree automata, and weighted mildly context-sensitive formalisms.
